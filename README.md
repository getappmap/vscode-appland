# AppMap for Visual Studio Code

AppMap Navie is an AI-driven chat with a deep understanding of your code. Build effective solutions
using an intuitive chat interface and powerful code visualizations. Use AppMap's runtime tracing to
improve the accuracy and depth of AI generation.

## Your AI Code Architect

AppMap Navie acts as an AI Code Architect, equipped with the context to deeply understand how your
application works. By reducing the time needed to research code changes and enhancing the context
available to your coding copilot, Navie becomes an indispensable tool in your workflow.

## Solve Complex Coding Issues with Confidence

AppMap Navie leverages runtime data and a structured workflow to help developers address challenging
coding problems. Navie's capabilities include:

- Writing comprehensive documentation
- Understanding existing systems
- Planning and implementing changes
- Generating code and test cases
- Performing thorough code reviews

## Get started

1. **Install
   [the AppMap extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=appland.appmap)** from
   within the code editor or from the marketplace.

2. **Sign in with an email address, or with GitHub or GitLab** and Navie will be available in
   `@explain` mode. This enables Navie to respond to general coding and development questions and
   answer questions about using AppMap data.

3. **Ask Navie** for guidance recording AppMap data specific to interactions or code scenarios
   you're interested in analyzing.

## Chat Modes

Navie provides different modes of interaction for an efficient workflow and optimized results from
AI-assisted coding.

![Chat Modes](https://github.com/getappmap/vscode-appland/blob/master/images/command-palette-menu.jpg?raw=true)

- **`@explain` (default)**: Navie makes context-aware suggestions, provides specific solutions, and
  reasons about the larger context of the specific code being worked on.

- **`@plan`**: Navie focuses the AI response on building a detailed implementation plan for the
  relevant query. This will focus Navie on only understanding the problem and the application to
  generate a step-by-step plan.

- **`@generate`**: Activate code generation mode by beginning any question with the prefix
  "@generate". In this mode Navie's response are optimized to include code snippets you can use
  directly in the files are working on.

- **`@test`**: Navie's responses are optimized for test case creation, such as unit testing or
  integration testing. This prefix will understand how your tests are currently written and provide
  updated tests based on features or code that is provided.

- **`@diagram`**: Navie will create and render a Mermaid compatible diagram within the Navie chat
  window. You can open this diagram in the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live), copy the
  Mermaid Definitions to your clipboard, save to disk, or expand a full window view.

- **`@search`**: By leveraging smart search capabilities, this command will locate specific code
  elements, relevant modules, or examples.

- **`@review`**: This command will review the code changes on your current branch and provide
  actionable insights on various aspects of code, ensuring alignment with best practices in areas
  such as code quality, security, and maintainability.

- **`@help`**: Activate help mode by beginning any question with the prefix "@help". This mode
  offers assistance with using AppMap, including guidance for generating and leveraging AppMap data
  effectively.

## Pinned Context

Pin specific data files to your conversation with Navie to include data sources you know are
relevant to the issue. This includes pinning the text of the issue itself, and Navie responses.
