# AppMap for Visual Studio Code

AppMap for Visual Studio Code is a runtime code analysis tool.

AppMap records detailed traces of your code, using a simple configuration that includes many useful
defaults for the language and framework you're using. Once you've recorded your code, it provides
powerful code **visualization** and two-way links between code and diagrams. And it includes
**automated analysis** that helps you find and fix common coding flaws in your code editor, before
you ship.

AppMap helps you and your colleagues ship **correct and efficient code** while spending less time on
code review and frustrating rework.

## Requirements

AppMap works best with web application and API frameworks, such as Ruby on Rails, Django, Flask,
Express, and Spring. That's because AppMap has built-in expertise about the frameworks and
techniques used to build back end code - including web services, view templates, HTTP client
requests, caching, authentication, and SQL. You can map any kind of project that’s written in a
supported language, but it’s when you map a database-backed web application or API service that
you’ll see the full power of AppMap.

## Summary of features

- [Record](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TWop5gpsFA) AppMap files of test cases and/or
  interactive sessions.
- [Visualize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LM8zqPUVlhI) detailed execution traces of HTP server
  requests, function calls, parameters, return values, exceptions, RPC calls, SQL, etc.
- &#x2728; **New** [Navigate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BiumbIh3-E) between code objects
  (classes, functions, HTTP routes, and SQL queries) and AppMap diagrams.
- &#x2728; **New** [Generate OpenAPI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPsTWA1AxmM&t=92s) with no
  code changes required.
- &#x2728; **New** [Analyze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAvPX5PFp7o) your code for performance
  and security flaws. See the next section for more details.

## AppMap Analysis

By hooking up the AppMap extension to the AppMap server, you'll gain access to powerful AppMap
Analysis capabilities.

AppMap Analysis runs in your local environment. It analyzes your AppMaps and highlights potential
problems in the categories of **Performance**, **Security**, and **Stability**. AppMap finds these
problems as you code, so you can investigate and fix them right away - **before you commit** and
push your code for review.

AppMap Analysis finds problems that **static analysis can't find** - and it's much **faster** than
dynamic security analysis (**DAST**).
