# AppMap for Visual Studio Code

AppMap is a free and open source visualization tool that allows you to see how your software works
as it’s running. You can use AppMaps to onboard to unfamiliar code, debug hard-to-fix issues, review
code behavior changes before making a commit, and improve the quality of code reviews.

AppMap works best for mapping web services and web applications.
[Join our community](https://appland.com/community/) to help us expand support for more types of
applications and frameworks!

## Requirements

Currently, AppMap supports Spring, Express.js, Django, Flask, Rails and Express projects
([AppMap for JavaScript](https://appland.com/docs/reference/appmap-javascript.html) is now available
in beta!). The most up-to-date list of frameworks and languages we support is
[here](https://appland.com/docs/integrations.html).

To start making AppMaps, you’ll need to install and configure the AppMap client agent for your
project. Then, you’ll make AppMaps by running your app - either by
[running test cases](https://appland.com/docs/recording-methods.html#recording-test-cases), or by
[recording a short interaction with your app](https://appland.com/docs/reference/remote-recording.html).

[Here's a convenient quickstart guide](https://appland.com/docs/quickstart/) that walks you through
the AppMap install flow.

## Summary of features

Summary of Features:

- Interactive maps of code’s behavior, so you can see what code is really doing as it runs,
  including:
  - Dependency maps that display how your app’s components are all connected, so you can quickly see
    how changes affect the big picture
  - Trace diagrams that show details about how a feature works, so you can find optimization
    opportunities and investigate tricky bugs
  - SQL query data, so you can see exactly what’s happening between your code and the database
  - Web services data, so you can see what message your app received and how it responded
  - Labels that identify the key functions in source code, so you can easily find critical code
    events and ensure they’re configured and used properly
