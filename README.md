# AppMap for Visual Studio Code

AppMap is a free and open source visualization tool that allows you to see how your software works
as it’s running. You can use AppMaps to onboard to unfamiliar code, debug hard-to-fix issues, review
code behavior changes before making a commit, and improve the quality of code reviews.

AppMap works best for mapping web services and web applications.

applications and frameworks!

## Summary of features

AppMap provides interactive maps of your application’s behavior, so you can see what your code is
really doing as it runs, including:

- Dependency maps that display how your app’s components are all connected, so you can quickly see
  how changes affect the big picture
- Trace diagrams that show details about how a feature works, so you can find optimization
  opportunities and investigate tricky bugs
- SQL query data, so you can see exactly what’s happening between your code and the database
- Web services data, so you can see what message your app received and how it responded
- Labels that identify the key functions in source code, so you can easily find critical code events
  and ensure they’re configured and used properly
