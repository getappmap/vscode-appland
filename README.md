# AppMap for Visual Studio Code

AppMap is a developer tools platform powered by runtime analysis and AI.  Navie is the first AI coding assistant with the context to understand how your app works when it runs, like a principal engineer or software architect.

Navie uses runtime application analysis to improve the quality and accuracy of AI-code suggestions.  Navie can answer more challenging questions about your app and help you with more complex tasks like: 

* Troubleshooting and debugging
* Refactoring & modernizing code
* Improving performance and stability
* Designing secure code


**Navie - AI code assistant**  
Navie AI is powered by a new type of AI code context provider, which combines source code snippets with AppMapâ€™s unique runtime data that you can create each time you run your code. When asked a question, Navie will search for the best context to answer your question including code snippets and AppMap data to provide answers truly specific to your app.

By default Navie uses GPT-4 through a proxy. You can change this to use a local LLM model of your choice, or you can bring your own LLM API key and Navie will communicate directly with your chosen LLM backend.

**AppMap data - runtime traces and interactive visualizations**  
AppMap data are displayed as interactive visualizations of your codeâ€™s behavior so you can see how your app works when it runs. Visualizations include: sequence diagrams, dependency maps, trace views, flame graphs for performance analysis. AppMap data is regular JSON files that are stored locally on your own filesystem.  


## Get started
1. **Install [the AppMap extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=appland.appmap)** from within the code editor or from the marketplace.  

2. **Sign in with an email address, or with GitHub or GitLab** and Navie will be available in `@explain` mode. This enables Navie to respond to general coding and development questions and answer questions about using AppMap data.

3. **Ask Navie** for guidance recording AppMap data specific to interactions or code scenarios you're interested in analyzing.
   

## Examples
Here are some examples of Navie making context-aware suggestions, providing tactical solutions, and reasoning about the larger context of the specific code being worked on.

1. [Find and fix slow API endpoints in a FastAPI app](https://appmap.io/navie/how-to/fix-slow-api-endpoints-in-a-fastapi-app-with-navie/)
2. [Find and fix a database performance issue in Ruby on Rails](https://appmap.io/navie/how-to/find-and-fix-a-database-performance-issue-in-ruby-on-rails/)
3. [Quickly add a new feature to a complex Python app](https://appmap.io/navie/how-to/adding-a-new-feature-to-a-complex-python-application/)
4. [Fixing performance issues with MongoDB in a MERN app](https://appmap.io/navie/how-to/fixing-performance-issues-with-mongodb-in-a-mern-app/)

## Chat Modes

Navie provides different modes of interaction to assist you with your code and project. Here's a quick overview:

- **`@explain` (default)**: Navie makes context-aware suggestions, provides specific solutions, and reasons about the larger context of the specific code being worked on.

- **`@help`**: Activate help mode by beginning any question with the prefix "@help". This mode offers assistance with using AppMap, including guidance for generating and leveraging AppMap data effectively.

- **`@generate`**: Activate code generation mode by beginning any question with the prefix "@generate". In this mode Navie's response are optimized to include code snippets you can use directly in the files are working on.

**ðŸ’¡ Ask Navie - Using the lightbulb -**: This feature is available in the Code Action menu when you have code selected. Choosing â€˜Ask Navieâ€™ from the Code Actions Menu initiates a new Navie chat populated with the snippet of selected code, enabling Navie answers based on that specific code snippet. Similarly, if you select some code in the active code window and open Navie, the selected code will be passed along.

## Bring your own key or model for Navie

In order to configure Navie for your own LLM, certain environment variables need to be set for AppMap services. Refer to the [AppMap documentation](https://appmap.io/docs/navie/bring-your-own-model.html) for details on how to do that.

## Creating AppMap Data

Ask Navie to guide you through the process of making AppMap data, or navigate to the Record AppMaps screen in your code editor.

Youâ€™ll start by configuring the AppMap language library for your project. Then youâ€™ll make a recording of the code you are working on by running your application in your development environment with AppMap enabled. AppMap data files will automatically be generated and stored on your local file system.

Once youâ€™ve recorded AppMap data, Navie's awareness of your applicationâ€™s behavior and code will be significantly upgraded.

Using AppMap data Navie can:
* Explain code or application behavior, including queries, web service requests, and more.
* Make code suggestions like a senior software developer.
* Find the potential performance problems or dynamic security flaws in existing or newly written code.
* Help you document application behavior changes for a PR.
* Navieâ€™s code recommendations span multiple files, functions, APIs, databases, and more.

Naive answers are backed up by references to AppMap data. Naive presents this data alongside the chat discussion, and you can also open and use AppMap diagrams independently of Navie.

AppMap diagrams include:

* **Sequence Diagrams** to follow the runtime flow of calls made by your application.
* **Dependency Maps** to see which libraries and frameworks were used at runtime.
* **Flame Graphs** to spot performance issues and bottlenecks.
* **Trace Views** to perform detailed function call and data flow tracing.

#### Requirements for making AppMap data

Supported programming languages: Node.js, Java (+ Kotlin), Ruby, and Python.
AppMap works particularly well with web application frameworks such as: Nest.js, Next.js, Spring, Ruby on Rails, Django, and Flask.

To start making AppMap data, youâ€™ll need to install and configure the AppMap client agent for your project.

Make AppMap data by running your appâ€”either by [running test cases](https://appmap.io/docs/recording-methods.html#recording-test-cases), or by [recording a short interaction with your app](https://appmap.io/docs/recording-methods.html#remote-recording).
