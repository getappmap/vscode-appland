# AppMap for Visual Studio Code

AppMap enhances the developer experience by analyzing runtime code
behavior before you commit changes and go to production.

AppMap records detailed traces of how your application runs and analyzes
it based on frameworks and techniques including web services, view
templates, HTTP client requests, caching, authentication, and SQL.

Bugs, loops, calls, dependencies, security issues, and more are found
with ease in trace views and sequence diagrams.

## Requirements

AppMap helps you understand any codebase or project that is written in a
supported web application or API framework, including Ruby on Rails,
Django, Flask, Express, and Spring. AppMap supports the following
programming languages: Java, Python, Ruby, Typescript, and JavaScript.

AppMap can also be used to map a database-backed web application or API
service, and instantly generate OpenAPI documentation based on the API
calls it observes at runtime.
